RecetteInLine
========

This project is created by erdnaxe : [https://github.com/erdnaxe/RecetteInLine](https://github.com/erdnaxe/RecetteInLine).
You can make a fork and comment it to improve it.

I create this project to make an easier way to make recipes on computer.

Sorry but the project is in french. A translation will come...

## How to use ##
Just make your recette.
Then, you can export it in pdf.

## Requirements for the host ##
* A web server: like "localhost" or a website.
* PHP: I develop this project with the last PHP (5.5).
* Folder listing disabled on the server (for crazy man...).

## Requirements for the client ##
* Internet connection because of the two JQuery librairies host on Google.
* Javascript support with a recent browser (IE 8+, chrome, firefox...).

## List of the librairies used ##
* First of all : [JQuery](http://jquery.com/).
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) (CSS and Javascript addons).
* [Atomik Framework](http://atomikframework.com/) for easy organising.

## Directory system ##
* In "vendor": all librairies I didn't create like JQuery.
* In "assets": all the JS, JSON, CSS and img files.
* In "app": all the server code or content catch by the page.

I apologise for my dirty english: I'm french ^^.
